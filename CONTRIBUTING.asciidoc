= Contributing

https://devonfw.com[devonfw] is truly free and open. 
We are looking forward to your contribution and are more than happy to receive your feedback and improvements to code and documentation.
This page describes the few conventions to follow.
Please note that this is an open and international project and all content has to be in English language.
Also read our link:code-of-conduct.asciidoc[code of conduct].

== Using github
We are using github.com as our social coding platform. Hence, we follow the principles of github to deal with changes:

=== Account
In case you do not have an account please first https://github.com/join[join github]. 
If you have a CORP username use it also as GitHub username. 
If possible and suitable also provide your real name in your profile.
Now that you are logged into github.com, you are ready to go.

=== Organizations
For devonfw we have the following organizations on github:

* link:https://github.com/devonfw/[*devonfw*]
+
The official _devonfw Platform_ organization.
* link:https://github.com/devonfw-forge[*devonfw-forge*]
+
The organization used for work on incubators and other research projects.
New projects start here and in case they evolve properly and get mature, they are moved to the official devonfw organization.

=== Repositories 
Within the organization we have many different repositories.
In case you want to give feedback or provide contributions you need to know the corresponding repository.

The major technology stacks have their own repository carrying the prefix `devon4` followed by a shortcut for their stack or programming language:

* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[devon4j] for https://java.com/[Java]
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng[devon4ng] for https://angular.io/[Angular]
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4net[devon4net] for https://dotnet.microsoft.com/[.NET]
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4x[devon4x] for https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin[Xamarin]
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4node[devon4node] for https://nodejs.org/[node.js]

Tools we provide typically have a repository named like the tool they provide (omitting prefixes like `devon[fw]`):

* https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen[CobiGen] (incremental code generator)
* https://github.com/devonfw/ide[devon-ide] (development environment)
* https://github.com/devonfw/sonar-devon4j-plugin[sonar-devon4j-plugin] (SonarQube plugin for architecture validation)
* https://github.com/devonfw/cicdgen[CICDgen] (generator for CI/CD)
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon-docgen[docgen] (generator for AsciiDoc to PDF and other formats)
* https://github.com/devonfw-forge/solicitor[solicitor] (License compatibility checker)
* https://github.com/devonfw/asciidoc-link-checker[asciidoc-link-checker]

There is much more to discover.
Browse our organization to find out.

=== Trivial changes
Please note that for trivial changes like a typo in the documentation you do not need to follow a complex process. Please do the following:

* Just browse to the file online on github.
* Click on the small pencil icon on the top right of the file content.
* Do the proposed changes.
* If available (when editing documentation) verify your change by switching to the `Preview` tab on the top.
* When your change is complete, select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request` at the bottom.
* Commit your change by clicking the green `Propose file change` button at the bottom.
* Now fill summary and description and click on the green `Create pull request` button.
* That is all. Thank you very much. For details about pull requests see below.

=== Issues
We are working issue-based, so check if there is already an issue in our tracker for the task you want to work.
Otherwise first create a new issue for it (e.g. a bug report or a feature request).

If you want to contribute actively to resolve the issue (by providing code, documentation, etc.),
please assure via communication in that issue (comments, assigned user, etc.) that this is recognized and accepted by somebody from the community.
Especially in case of more complex issues, please get sure not to miss out such consensus with the community 
and ensure that there is a common understanding of what and potentially even how to do it.
You surely do not want to invest your valuable work and time into something that will later be rejected by the community.
When you have been assigned to the issue (see `Assignees` on the right) you are sure that nobody else will work on the same issue in parallel and ready to go.

=== Branches
Typically the latest development takes place on the `develop` branch.
In case there is no such branch it will be the `master` branch.
If you plan to contribute a bugfix, please check if there is a maintenance branch for the corresponding release (e.g. if you found a bug in version 3.4.5 and a branch `develop-3.4.x` exists, this should be the baseline for your work).

=== Forking
The github.com platform supports a wonderful feature to https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork a repository].
Make use of this to create your private copy where you experiment and prepare your contribution in an isolated environment:

* Visit the original repository you want to contribute to.
* Click on the `Fork` button at the top right. If asked for a destination, choose your personal github account.
* Clone this fork with a git-client to your local machine.
* Checkout the branch to use as baseline (see above section).
* From there create and checkout a new feature-branch (named `feature/«issue-id»-«feature-keywords»`).
* Start your work on this new feature-branch.

=== Code Changes
Before you start with your code changes, please check the following conventions:

* For each programming language we have a stack repository (see above) containing documentation about the coding conventions (example: https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/develop/documentation/coding-conventions.asciidoc[Java]). Please read and follow these conventions before doing (bigger) changes.
* Use https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/Home.asciidoc[devon-ide] to setup your development environment and get code formatters, etc. configured properly as we do not like "diff-wars" because of inconsistent formatter settings.
* Thank you, happy coding!

=== Documentation Changes
Before you start with your documentation changes, please check the following conventions:

* Documentation will always be found in the `documentation` folder at the root of a repository.
* All our documentation is written in the http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] format.
* All documentation files need to carry the `.asciidoc` extension and should be named in `lower-train-case` style.
* Common prefixes help to categorize documentation files: `tutorial-` is used for step-by-step instructions, `guide-` is used for guidelines on a particular aspect, `coding-` is for specific conventions or details about source-code, `alternative-` is for less official options that are not recommended as first class citizen but to still share knowledge for people using that option, `decision-` is for rationales why a complex (technology) decision was taken.
* Please read and follow our https://github.com/devonfw/devon-docgen/#guidelines[documentation guidelines].

=== Testing changes
To test your changes all you need to do is run the following command:
[source]
devon build

If the build failed, you need to rework your changes.

=== Committing Changes
Always commit your changes in small logical units associated with an issue (see above section) using the commit message format:
[source]
#«issue-id»: «describe your change»
Then github will automatically link the commit with the issue. 

Example:
[source]
#1: added REST service for tablemanagement

In case you worked on an issue from a different repository (e.g. change in `ide-settings` due to issue in `ide`), we use this commit message format:
[source]
«organization»/«repository»#«issue-id»: «describe your change»

Example:
[source]
devonfw/devon4j#1: added REST service for tablemanagement

=== Pushing Changes
To make your changes public you need to push them.
If you are doing this for the first time since you started your feature branch, you also need to publish that branch (`git push -u origin feature/«issue-id»-«feature-keywords»`).
After that a `git push` is sufficient.

=== Definition of Done
To complete your changes ensure the following aspects:

* You have tested your changes and the build succeeds.
* Code and documentation are in sync (if you coded new features you also extended documentation, etc.).
* You followed the coding conventions and documentation guidelines.
* For new features you have added automated unit tests.

Do not worry, we will assist you in case you are unsure or missed out on something.
However, you make your and our life easier if you follow this Definition of Done (DoD) before providing your pull request.

=== Pull Request
Once you have completed your changes and DoD, you can finally https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request[create] a https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests[pull request] (PR).

Please ensure the following aspects:

* Follow the same conventions as for commit messages (see above) also for the title of the pull request.
* In case you are providing a https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests[PR] that is not yet ready for merging, please prefix the title with `WIP:`. This can be helpful to get feedback from https://travis-ci.com[travis] or start early discussions on complex changes. Once you reached a state ready to be merged, simply edit the title and remove the `WIP:` prefix.
* Also add the issue(s) to the description of the pull request (e.g. `fixes #«issue-id»`).
* Finally, click on the green `Create Pull Request` button.

Your pull request will automatically be checked if ...

* it can be merged without conflicts,
* it builds correctly (no compile or test errors),
* the https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devon-guide/wiki/cookbook-cla[CLA] has been signed. If you contribute for the first time, you need to https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devon-guide/wiki/cookbook-cla[sign the CLA] once.

Please ensure to do the required tasks and reworks unless all checks are satisfied.
From here a reviewer should take over and give feedback.
In the best case, your contribution gets merged and everything is completed.
You might also get review feedback and requests for changes.
In that case walk through the review feedback and try to resolve it.
Once you push your new commits, the PR gets updated automatically and all checks will verify again.
Also github will automatically mark resolved review comments as outdated.
If you do not plan to put any further work into your PR before it is completed and merged, please let us know by writing an according comment.
We might find resources to get the PR done for you if it is already valuable.
In case you should not get feedback for weeks, do not hesitate to ask the community.

NOTE: If one (typically the reviewer) has to change the base branch (because the wrong develop branch was used, see above) onto which the changes will be merged, one can do the same by following the instructions at https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request/[here].
